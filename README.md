# SuiviClair - Privacy-First Supply Chain Management on Starknet

SuiviClair ("Clear Tracking" in French) is a revolutionary privacy-centric supply chain management dApp built on Starknet, leveraging both Cairo SDK and Calimero SDK to provide secure, private, and transparent supply chain operations.

## 🔒 Privacy Features

- **Private Shipment Data**: Using Calimero SDK for encrypted storage of sensitive shipment details
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Leveraging Starknet's Cairo for verifiable tracking without revealing sensitive data
- **Selective Disclosure**: Granular control over what information is shared with different stakeholders
- **Private State Channels**: Secure communication channels between parties using Calimero's privacy infrastructure

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Private Shipment Creation**:
  - Encrypted product details
  - Private origin/destination locations
  - Confidential temperature and humidity settings
  - Secure document attachments

- **Privacy-Preserving Tracking**:
  - Zero-knowledge location updates
  - Encrypted environmental monitoring
  - Private transit history
  - Selective data sharing

- **Secure Quality Control**:
  - Private inspection records
  - Encrypted quality metrics
  - Confidential inspector notes
  - Secure alert system

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Blockchain & Privacy**:
  - Starknet (Layer 2 scaling with built-in privacy)
  - Cairo SDK (Zero-knowledge proofs and secure computation)
  - Calimero SDK (Privacy infrastructure and secure data management)

- **Frontend**:
  - React + TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS
  - Starknet.js
  - Calimero Client SDK

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Cairo SDK Integration
- Zero-knowledge proofs for shipment verification
- Private state transitions
- Secure computation for supply chain logic
- Privacy-preserving smart contracts

### Calimero SDK Usage
- Encrypted data storage
- Private state channels
- Secure key management
- Confidential transaction handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Cairo toolchain
- Calimero SDK access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcusDavidG/SuiviClair.git
cd SuiviClair
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Calimero and Starknet credentials
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🏗 Architecture

### Privacy Layer (Calimero SDK)
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure communication channels
- Private state management
- Access control

### Zero-Knowledge Layer (Cairo SDK)
- ZK-proofs generation
- Private computation
- Secure state transitions
- Verification logic

## 🔐 Privacy Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted using Calimero SDK
- Zero-knowledge proofs ensure verifiability without data exposure
- Granular access control for different stakeholders
- Secure key management and rotation

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run Cairo tests
cairo-test ./tests

# Run frontend tests
npm test
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Advanced ZK-proof schemes for complex supply chain operations
- Enhanced privacy-preserving analytics
- Multi-party computation features
- Cross-chain private bridges
