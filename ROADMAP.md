# SuiviClair Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
SuiviClair is a privacy-first supply chain management solution built on Starknet, leveraging Cairo for zero-knowledge proofs and Calimero for private data management. The project aims to provide transparent yet private supply chain operations.

## Current Implementation Status

### Development Environment
- ✅ Scarb setup for Cairo development
- ✅ Vite + React + TypeScript frontend configuration
- ✅ Initial smart contract structure
- ✅ Basic frontend architecture
- ✅ Git repository initialization

### Smart Contracts
- ✅ Basic contract structure with privacy features
- ✅ Shipment data encryption framework
- ✅ Access control system
- ✅ Zero-knowledge proof verification structure

### Frontend
- ✅ Project structure setup
- ✅ Starknet integration configuration
- ✅ Basic hooks for contract interaction
- ✅ Development server configuration
